# School_District_Analysis
#
## Overview

Students were asked to repeat steps in generating dataframes that show reading and math scores for a specific school and then repeat steps to generate summaries by
school, school district and school type to determine if there was some dishonesty in academic reporting by Thomas High School.

This module required students to utilize their Pandas dataframe and Series skills to set math and reading scores for the ninth grade in Thomas High School to NaN's (not a numeric) 
to see how the remaining grade summaries at Thomas High School are relative to the other schools and impact to district and school type summaries.

Functions such as loc() and map() functions were used to update and format data so that dataframes were properly presenting money and grades in a readable format.  The numpy
library also provided a way to identify NaN's. 

## Results

There is a bulleted list that describes the balanced accuracy score and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models (15 pt)

## Summary
